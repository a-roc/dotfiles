This is my setup, i3, polybar, terminator on Arch.

Why terminator?  It's easier to use than anything else I've found.

Needs: i3-gaps (i3 group in Arch, really), polybar from AUR, pamixer, 
font-awesome (for both i3bar and polybar), pamixer for pulseaudio,
pulseaudio, compton, and adapta for gtk and QT (i use kvantum).

Optional: pcmanfm for file management (never got into the CLI stuff).
